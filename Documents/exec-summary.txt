SafeRent Solutions LLC currently operates several applications that use a legacy ASP.NET Forms-based authentication model, where each system manages its own credentials, sessions, and authorization logic. This decentralized approach increases operational overhead, limits scalability, and creates inconsistent security controls across platforms.
The goal of this project is to modernize SafeRentâ€™s identity and access management architecture by implementing a Single Sign-On (SSO) solution based on Auth0, a cloud-native Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) platform. The new solution will centralize authentication, authorization, and user management across all SafeRent products, enabling a seamless and secure login experience for customers, partners, and internal users.
The target architecture will leverage industry standards such as OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0 to replace forms-based authentication with token-based security. Auth0 will serve as the centralized Identity Provider (IdP), managing user identities, enforcing access policies, and integrating with external providers such as Azure Active Directory and Google Workspace. This architecture enhances security through multi-factor authentication (MFA) and unified policy enforcement while simplifying compliance with standards such as SOC 2 and GDPR.
The solution will be implemented in phased stages, starting with key applications during the MVP phase and expanding to all systems over time. Once complete, SafeRent will achieve a modern, scalable, and secure SSO ecosystem, improving user experience, reducing maintenance effort, and aligning identity management with future growth and cloud transformation initiatives.
