workspace.dsl consists of all modules of the solution. 

I need resource plan for the solution.
All components are listed in workspace.dsl
The resource plan should be generated in CSV format:
1)component_name - Component name
2)component_description - Component description
3)risk_level - one of three levels [Low, Medium, High]
Next four columns consist efforn in working days for the teams which depends on risk level. 
4)tNet - BackEnd developers (.NET)
5)tDBD - DB developers
6)tDBA - DB admins
7)tDesing - UX design
8)tReact - UI developers
9)tDevOps - DevOps
Components records in dsl format have the following structure: 
variable_name = component component_name component_description component_technology component_tags.
component_tags element consists of tags, one or more of the tags can be a team name. 
You should extract team from tags field and estimate effort in working days for each of the components.
Components records should be grouped by containers.
For instanse, first records for Access Data Service should be like that:
"component_name","component_description","risk_level","tNet","tDBD","tDBA","tDesing","tReact"
"Access Data Service", "Provides search, view, subscription, and export functionality for shared Prefix, GIN, and LN data"
"Access Search Engine", "Performs advanced search and filtering across Prefix, GIN, and LN datasets", "Medium", 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
"Record Viewer", "Displays record details, including basic/full data and hierarchy", "Medium", 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
"Subscription Manager", "Handles subscription requests for accessing full record views", "High", 15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
